'''
Sets:

- Unordered
- Unique Collection
- Created with {}

Definition: A set is a collection of well defined objects, where elements cannot be repeated!
'''

s = {3, 23, 2, 11}

print(s, type(s))

# print(s[3]) # This will give an error, since set is not subscriptable

'''
We can add the elements, but since the sets are unordered collection of elements, you cannot access element at a particular index...
