# Python Course Recap

This repository is a person recap of my Python learning journey, created as a part of a structured revision of core-programming concepts.
It covers topics from the absolute basics to more advanced concepts, along with small projects to apply the learning.

The folder structure follows a logical progression, starting with environment setup and syntax, moving through variables, control flow, data structures, functions, object-oriented programming, and external modules, and concluding with mini-projects.  
While some of the sequence was inspired by the **CodeWithHarry Python series**, the content reflects my own practice, experiments, and additional exercises added along the way.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A record of my own revision of Python fundamentals.
- A reference for my practicing core concepts and seeing their applications in small-scale projects.
- A resource that reflects consistent learning and application of programming skills.

## Acknowledgement

Special thanks to [@CodeWithHarry](https://github.com/codewithharry), the sequence followed is inspired by **CodeWithHarry's** Python tutorial which I used as a guide during this recap.
The code, examples, and additional exercises were performed by my own self, adapted and extended during practice.
